# CleanRoute: Web Tool for LEAP & LCO2 routes
This is a web tool for finding out least air pollution and least carbon dioxide emission path. It also features routes and air pollution exposure forecasting capabilities.

## Component Repositories:
This project is organized into three distinct sub-repositories, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **[Client (User Interface)](https://github.com/sadityakumar9211/clean-route-frontend):**
   The first sub-repository contains the codebase for the user interface client. This component focuses on delivering an intuitive and engaging user experience.

3. **[Backend Server](https://github.com/sadityakumar9211/clean-route-backend)**:
   The second sub-repository encompasses the calculation server. This repository is dedicated to handling complex computations and data processing.

4. **[Server with Deployed ML models](https://github.com/sadityakumar9211/clean-route-aws):**
   The third sub-repository hosts the deployed machine learning server. Here, the focus is on providing an environment for serving and interacting with machine learning models.

By structuring the project into these component repositories, we ensure a modular and organized approach, making it easier to manage, develop, and deploy each distinct aspect of the project.

All the three repositories are hosted on AWS.
